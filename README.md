🔐 Flask Authentication Lab

📌 Overview

This project is a simple Authentication System built with Flask and SQLite.
It demonstrates how user login, registration, and session management work in web applications.
The lab also highlights common security issues (like storing plain-text passwords) and how to fix them using password hashing and secure session handling.
